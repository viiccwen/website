Behind ClickHouse's high-performance queries, in addition to columnar storage and vectorized execution, **compression** and **Data Skipping Indexes** are also core reasons why it can handle PB-scale data. This article explains the principles and use cases behind both techniques, and shows how they improve query efficiency and reduce storage costs.

> [One of the secrets to ClickHouse query performance is compression.](https://clickhouse.com/docs/data-compression/compression-in-clickhouse)

## Why compression matters for OLAP performance

In OLAP workloads, the data volume can easily reach millions or tens of millions of rows. Without good compression, disk I/O quickly becomes the bottleneck. ClickHouse uses Columnar Storage, which makes each column consistent in type and highly repetitive, so compression works extremely well.

### Benefits of ClickHouse compression:
* **Lower storage usage** (compression ratios are often 5 to 10 times or more)
* **Less disk I/O transfer** (faster reads, lower latency)
* **Better CPU decompression performance** (using lightweight, fast compression algorithms)

## Compression codecs supported by ClickHouse

| Compression codec | Characteristics and use cases |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **LZ4 (default)** | Fast and low-latency, moderate compression ratio, default codec, suitable for real-time queries and writes |
| **ZSTD** | Better compression ratio than LZ4, but slightly slower compression and decompression; good for cold storage or report analysis |
| **Delta Encoding** | Compresses increasing numeric values such as timestamps and IDs by storing differences, greatly reducing storage usage |
| **Gorilla Encoding** | Highly optimized for time-series data, suitable for IoT and telemetry compression such as CPU usage or temperature |
| **Double Delta** | Useful for numeric data with smooth trends, improving compression further |

Below are compression statistics for a ClickHouse table storing StackOverflow posts. The query uses `system.columns` to retrieve the compressed and uncompressed size of each column, as well as the compression ratio.

```sql
SELECT name,
   formatReadableSize(sum(data_compressed_bytes)) AS compressed_size,
   formatReadableSize(sum(data_uncompressed_bytes)) AS uncompressed_size,
   round(sum(data_uncompressed_bytes) / sum(data_compressed_bytes), 2) AS ratio
FROM system.columns
WHERE table = 'posts'
GROUP BY name

```

You can see that:
* Highly repetitive columns such as `FavoriteCount` and `ContentLicense` can reach compression ratios of hundreds or even thousands to one. That is the advantage of columnar storage combined with specialized codecs.
* Numeric columns such as `Score`, `AcceptedAnswerId`, and `PostTypeId` also compress very well. Delta encoding combined with LZ4 or ZSTD can greatly reduce data size.
* Although `Body` and `Title` are text columns, they still achieve a 2-3x compression ratio, and combining them with LowCardinality will improve space efficiency even more.

## How do you specify a compression algorithm?

You can specify codecs for individual columns when creating a table using the `CODEC` parameter:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_events (
  event_date Date,
  user_id UInt32,
  event_type String CODEC(ZSTD),
  event_value Float64 CODEC(Delta, LZ4)
) ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date)
ORDER BY (event_date, user_id);
```

### Explanation:

* `event_type` uses ZSTD, which is good for highly repetitive string columns.
* `event_value` uses Delta encoding for numeric values and then LZ4 for compression, improving both query speed and storage efficiency.

## How Data Skipping Indexes work in ClickHouse

**Data Skipping Indexes** are a ClickHouse-specific query acceleration technique. The core idea is:

> **At query time, scan only the necessary data blocks, skip irrelevant blocks, and reduce I/O cost and latency.**

These are not traditional B-Tree indexes. Instead, they are a fast filtering mechanism built on column statistics inside MergeTree data parts.

## How does minmax indexing work?

Each MergeTree part automatically creates a `minmax` index for the primary key columns, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01' AND order_date < '2025-02-01';
```

* The system checks the `min(order_date)` and `max(order_date)` range of each data block.
* If a block's date range cannot possibly match the query conditions, it is skipped completely.

Suppose you have one billion log rows:

* With the default minmax index, a query for one day of data can skip 99% of the blocks.
* Query latency can drop from 15 seconds to 300 milliseconds.
* The system only reads and decompresses 1% of the data, which saves a huge amount of CPU and I/O.

That is the effect of **Partition Pruning + Data Skipping**.

## Advanced: secondary index implementation

ClickHouse also lets you build more advanced indexes on specific columns, for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
  timestamp DateTime,
  level String,
  message String
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY timestamp
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192;

ALTER TABLE logs ADD INDEX idx_level (level) TYPE set(1000) GRANULARITY 1;
```

### Index type reference:

| Index type | Description and use case |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `minmax` | Default; speeds up range queries on numeric or date values |
| `set(N)` | Set-based index, good for highly repetitive string columns such as log levels |
| `ngrambf_v1` | Suitable for fuzzy queries and uses a bloom filter for fast matching |
| `bloom_filter` | Quickly filters possible values, good for multi-value columns such as tags or labels |


## Best practices and notes

* **Index granularity**: the default `index_granularity` is 8192 rows. If queries are frequent, the granularity can be reduced a bit to improve skipping efficiency.
* **Use compression and indexes together**: compression reduces data size, and indexes reduce the scanned range. Together they deliver excellent query performance.
* **Do not overuse indexes**: too many indexes increase write overhead, so create them only for frequently queried columns.

## Closing thoughts

With efficient compression and skipping indexes, ClickHouse can return big-data queries in milliseconds. Just do not overuse indexes, or the result may be worse than a table scan.
