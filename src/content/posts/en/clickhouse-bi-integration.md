In enterprise data analytics scenarios, BI (Business Intelligence) tools are the bridge that turns data into business decisions. Although ClickHouse provides powerful query and aggregation capabilities, integrating a BI tool is the natural next step if you want to visualize analysis results and enable interactive exploration.

Common BI tools that integrate with ClickHouse include:

* **Metabase**: Open source and easy to use, suitable for fast deployment in small and mid-sized teams
* **Apache Superset**: Open source and highly customizable, with support for many data sources
* **Power BI**: Microsoft's flagship BI tool, with strong integration and tight connectivity with Excel and Office 365

This article uses **Power BI** as an example to show how to import ClickHouse data and build visual analytics on top of it.

## Why Integrate Power BI with ClickHouse

Power BI offers the following advantages in enterprise environments:

1. **Integration with the Microsoft ecosystem** (Excel, Teams, Azure, and more)
2. **Real-time dashboard updates**, which pair well with ClickHouse's high-performance queries
3. **Easy sharing and permission control** (supports AD and RBAC)
4. **Support for DirectQuery / Import modes**

## Integration Steps: Connecting Power BI to ClickHouse

### 1. Install the ClickHouse ODBC Driver

Power BI does not currently provide a native ClickHouse connector, so you need to use the **ODBC Driver**.

Installation steps (Windows example):

1. Go to the official ClickHouse download page
   [https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-odbc/releases](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-odbc/releases)
2. Download the version that matches your system (it is recommended to use the 64-bit version compatible with Power BI Desktop)
3. After installation, add a DSN in ODBC Data Source Administrator:

   * Driver: ClickHouse ODBC Unicode
   * Server: `<ClickHouse Host>`
   * Port: `8123`
   * Database: `default`
   * User: `default`
   * Password: `default`

### 2. Add the Data Source in Power BI

1. Open **Power BI Desktop**
2. Click **Get Data**
3. Search for and select **ODBC**
4. Choose the **ClickHouse DSN** you just configured
5. Enter a ClickHouse SQL query (or select a table directly)

Example query:

```sql
SELECT
    toStartOfDay(EventDate) AS day,
    Action,
    count() AS action_count
FROM user_events
GROUP BY day, Action
ORDER BY day ASC;
```

### 3. Configure the Import Mode

Power BI provides two ways to connect to ClickHouse:

| Mode              | Characteristics | Suitable scenarios |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Import** | Imports data into Power BI with local cache. Query speed is fast, but updates require manual or scheduled refresh. | Static reports, daily or hourly refreshes |
| **DirectQuery** | Connects to ClickHouse in real time on every query, ensuring fresh data, but performance depends on ClickHouse query speed. | Real-time monitoring, low-latency requirements |

For real-time monitoring scenarios, **DirectQuery** is recommended so you can fully benefit from ClickHouse's fast query engine.

### 4. Build Visualizations

In Power BI, you can create many chart types:

* **Line chart**: Daily event count trends
* **Pie chart**: Distribution of Action types
* **Stacked column chart**: Distribution of different actions across different dates
* **Card**: Key metrics (such as today's event count and active users)

Example dashboard:

| Panel Name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Daily Event Trend** | A line chart showing the total number of daily events |
| **Action Type Distribution** | A pie chart showing the percentage of each Action |
| **User Activity Distribution** | A bar chart ranking users by event count |

## Performance Optimization Suggestions

| Strategy | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Use Materialized View summary tables | Precompute complex aggregations for Power BI queries and avoid scanning large tables |
| Adopt a Partition Key | Partition by date or business dimensions in ClickHouse to reduce scan scope |
| Use DirectQuery + efficient SQL | Ensure Power BI queries respond in real time |
| Reduce row count | Use `LIMIT` and `WHERE` to filter unnecessary historical data |

## Comparison with Other BI Tools

| Tool | Characteristics | Suitable scenarios |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Metabase** | Easy to install, open-source, free, supports SQL and GUI queries | Fast deployment for small and mid-sized teams |
| **Superset** | Open source, supports multiple data sources, highly customizable | Technical teams that need flexible extensibility |
| **Power BI** | Enterprise-grade BI with Microsoft ecosystem integration | Enterprise reporting and cross-department collaboration |

## Closing Thoughts

Through an ODBC connection, ClickHouse can integrate seamlessly with Power BI and combine ClickHouse's analytics power with Power BI's visualization and sharing capabilities to build an efficient, real-time business analytics platform.

For real-time analytics scenarios, a strong recommendation is **DirectQuery** together with ClickHouse Materialized Views. This keeps data fresh while reducing query load.
