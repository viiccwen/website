When you are dealing with hundreds of millions or even billions of rows, query performance will collapse if every query has to scan the whole table. ClickHouse provides flexible **Partitioning** and **Partition Pruning** so that queries only scan the data blocks that are truly relevant, drastically reducing I/O and latency.

## What is a Partition?

In ClickHouse, a **partition is a logical way to split data**. Data is split into independent blocks (directories) based on a specified Partition Key expression, and those blocks can be filtered during query time to avoid full table scans.

### Important characteristics:

* Partitioning is one of the core structures of the MergeTree engine.
* The Partition Key can be any expression, such as `toYYYYMM(date)`, `device_id`, or `region_id`.
* Partitioning happens at the physical directory level, which makes the optimization effect very obvious.
* The smaller the partitioning scope, the more data queries can skip, but the more small files and merge overhead you create.

## Difference between Partition and Primary Key

| Comparison item | Partition | Primary Key |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Scope | Splits data directories at the disk level | Sorted index inside blocks at the storage-engine level |
| Query pruning | If the query matches the Partition Key, the block can be skipped directly | If the query matches the Primary Key, the data block can be located precisely |
| Design basis | Common range conditions, such as date or business region | Fine-grained query conditions, such as `user_id` or `order_id` |

The two are complementary: Partition is used for coarse range pruning, while Primary Key is used for precise positioning.

## How Partition Pruning works

Partition Pruning means ClickHouse uses the `WHERE` clause to determine which partitions cannot possibly contain matching data and skips them entirely.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE page_views
(
    event_date Date,
    user_id UInt64,
    page String
) ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date)
ORDER BY (event_date, user_id);
```

### Query:

```sql
SELECT count() FROM page_views
WHERE event_date >= '2025-08-01' AND event_date < '2025-08-02';
```

* ClickHouse uses the `toYYYYMM(event_date)` Partition Key to determine that only the 202508 partition could match. All other partitions are skipped and are not scanned.

## Partition Key design strategy

| Design strategy | Suitable scenario |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Split by time dimension (`toYYYYMM`, `toYYYYMMDD`)** | Time-series data, log systems, and traffic monitoring (choose granularity based on query frequency) |
| **Split by business dimension (`region_id`, `device_type`)** | Scenarios where different regions or device types are queried independently, suitable for sharding and query load balancing |
| **Composite partitions (for example, `toYYYYMM(date)`, `region_id`)** | Time + region workloads, but be careful not to create too many partitions |
| **Avoid high-cardinality fields for partitioning** | Columns such as `user_id` or UUID are not good Partition Keys, or you will create too many small files |

## Balancing granularity and efficiency

| Granularity | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| toYYYYMM | Moderate partition count, suitable for querying data over several months | Cross-month queries are only average in efficiency, and merges happen more often after writes |
| toYYYYMMDD | Can improve pruning to day-level granularity, good for logs and real-time querying | Produces many small parts and increases disk IOPS plus background merge overhead |
| Composite partitioning (time + dimension) | Finest granularity and excellent pruning | Be careful of partition explosion (it is recommended to keep the Partition Key under 10,000 values) |

## How can you verify that Partition Pruning is working?

1. **Use `EXPLAIN`**:

```sql
EXPLAIN PLAN SELECT * FROM page_views WHERE event_date = '2025-08-01';
```

2. **Check partition read stats (`system.parts`)**:

```sql
SELECT
    partition,
    active,
    rows,
    bytes_on_disk
FROM system.parts
WHERE table = 'page_views' AND active;
```

3. **Inspect query profile events**:

```sql
SET send_logs_level = 'trace';
SELECT count() FROM page_views WHERE event_date = '2025-08-01';
```

In the query profile events, you can check whether `read_rows` and `read_bytes` have dropped significantly.

## Real-world example

Suppose a website stores 3 billion click records per month. Without partitioning, querying a single day would require a full table scan and could take tens of seconds due to I/O latency. If you set the Partition Key to `toYYYYMMDD(event_date)`:

* A single-day query only scans 1/30 of the data.
* Query latency can drop from 30 seconds to under 1 second.
* Combining this with a Primary Key such as `page` and `user_id` lets you filter even more precisely.

## Relationship between Partition and Sharding

| Partition | Sharding |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Splits data inside one table into multiple blocks so the query range can be pruned | Horizontally splits the entire table across different nodes in the cluster to improve distributed computing capacity |
| Affects only the scan range of single-table queries | Affects where the data lives and the distributed query execution path |
| Pruning relies on WHERE conditions and reduces scanned data | Pruning relies on the shard key and distributed routing rules to decide which nodes must participate |

They can be combined, for example:

* Shard key = `user_id` (balanced writes across shards)
* Partition key = `toYYYYMM(date)` (faster range queries)

## Best practices and notes

| Best practice | Description |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Design the Partition Key based on query patterns | Use the most common WHERE range conditions, such as date or region, as the pruning dimension |
| Be careful about partition explosion | Avoid high-cardinality columns as partition keys; aim to keep the number of partitions within a few thousand to ten thousand |
| Monitor partition health with `system.parts` | Regularly check Active Parts counts and sizes to avoid too many small files hurting merge performance |
| Combine with Primary Key for precise positioning | Partition handles coarse pruning, Primary Key handles fine pruning, and together they give the best query performance |
| Do not change the Partition Key frequently | Changing it is effectively the same as rebuilding the table, so design it carefully upfront |

## Closing thoughts

Partition Pruning is one of ClickHouse's most powerful query acceleration techniques when working with large datasets. With a sensible partitioning strategy, you can reduce I/O pressure and still keep OLAP reports and real-time queries in the millisecond range even at TB scale.
