When handling large-scale aggregate queries, ClickHouse has more than just Partition Pruning and Data Skipping Indexes to speed things up (~~if you've forgotten them, go review them again~~). There is another powerful query optimization tool: **Projections**.

Projections can pre-sort, pre-aggregate, or reorganize data structures so that the query execution path becomes **shorter and faster**.

## What Is a Projection?

A Projection is an internal materialized structure stored inside table parts. It pre-builds sorted or aggregated results for specific query patterns.

| Feature               | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Part of the table     | Projection data lives with the table in the same data part. |
| Automatically used at query time | You do not need to change the query syntax. ClickHouse automatically chooses the projection with the lowest scan cost. |
| Multiple projections supported | You can define different projections for different query needs. |


## Advantages of Projections

1. **Reduce the amount of data scanned** -> read only the projection instead of scanning the entire table.
2. **Speed up aggregation** -> use precomputed aggregation results directly at query time.
3. **Lower I/O load** -> disk reads drop significantly, which reduces query latency.

## Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_events
(
    EventDate Date,
    UserID UInt64,
    Action String,
    Version UInt32
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate)
ORDER BY (UserID, EventDate)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
AS
SELECT * FROM source_table;

ALTER TABLE user_events
ADD PROJECTION daily_user_action_counts
(
    SELECT
        EventDate,
        Action,
        count() AS ActionCount
    GROUP BY
        EventDate,
        Action
);
```

After running `OPTIMIZE TABLE user_events FINAL`, ClickHouse writes the projection data into the table parts in the background.

## Projection Hits Automatically at Query Time

As long as the query matches the projection structure, ClickHouse will automatically use the projection to speed up the query:

```sql
SELECT EventDate, Action, count() 
FROM user_events 
WHERE EventDate = '2025-08-10' 
GROUP BY EventDate, Action;
```

You can use `EXPLAIN PLAN` to see that the query is using the projection:

```sql
EXPLAIN PLAN SELECT EventDate, Action, count() FROM user_events WHERE EventDate = '2025-08-10' GROUP BY EventDate, Action;

Projection: daily_user_action_counts
ReadFromMergeTree (using projection)
```

## Practice: A Case Where Projections Speed Things Up by 10x

Suppose `user_events` has 1 billion rows, and you run this query:

```sql
SELECT EventDate, Action, count() 
FROM user_events 
WHERE EventDate >= '2025-08-01' 
GROUP BY EventDate, Action;
```

* **Without a projection**: the query must scan all 1 billion rows and takes 20 seconds.
* **With a projection**: only 10 million projection rows are scanned, and the query takes just **2 seconds**.

This kind of workload is especially suitable for BI reports and high-frequency aggregation queries on dashboards.

## Notes and Limitations

| Limitation                            | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Projection design must be planned in advance | Once a projection is defined, its structure cannot be modified. |
| INSERT writes to projections too       | Writes will incur some extra CPU overhead.                |
| `OPTIMIZE TABLE` must merge projection data | After projection data is written, you need to run Optimize to merge the projection parts. |

## Conclusion

Projections are one of ClickHouse's core tools for accelerating large-scale aggregation queries. With a well-designed projection, you can instantly improve query performance by several times.

For reporting and real-time dashboard scenarios, using Projections wisely can significantly reduce system load and query latency, making them a useful tool in big-data analytics.
