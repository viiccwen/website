As cloud-native architecture becomes more common, more and more teams adopting ClickHouse have to choose between **ClickHouse Cloud (the official managed cloud service)** and a **self-managed ClickHouse cluster**.

## 1. What Is ClickHouse Cloud?

**ClickHouse Cloud** is the **fully managed cloud service** provided officially by ClickHouse. It allows developers and data engineers to avoid infrastructure operations work and focus on building data analytics applications.

### Features:

* No need to manage clusters, storage, node configuration, or upgrades yourself
* Elastic scaling of compute and storage resources (pay as you go)
* Built-in high availability (HA), automatic backups, and zero-downtime upgrades
* Direct integration with AWS and GCP

## 2. Self-Hosted ClickHouse Deployment

Organizations can also choose to install ClickHouse on their own virtual machines (VMs) or in Kubernetes environments and build a dedicated ClickHouse cluster.

### Characteristics of a self-hosted architecture:

* Full control over ClickHouse configuration, resource scheduling, and network isolation
* Ability to design custom storage tiers as needed (SSD + HDD + S3)
* Flexible choice of monitoring, DevOps, and automation toolchains (such as Ansible, Terraform, and Zabbix)
* Can align with internal security policies (private networking, specific IAM authentication methods)

## 3. ClickHouse Cloud vs. Self-Hosted Deployment

| Item | ClickHouse Cloud | Self-Hosted ClickHouse |
| ---- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Getting started speed** | Fast, usable as soon as the service is enabled | Requires installation, setup, and configuration |
| **Operations burden** | Managed for you (automatic upgrades, backups, monitoring) | You must maintain node health, upgrades, and monitoring yourself |
| **Resource scheduling flexibility** | Expand on demand in the cloud with usage-based billing | You must manage capacity planning and scaling strategy yourself |
| **Initial cost** | Low, pay according to usage | Higher in setup cost and time |
| **Long-term cost** | Costs can rise noticeably with large traffic and storage volumes | After acquiring resources, long-term operating cost can be lower |
| **Performance tuning** | Some parameters are not customizable because the cloud platform controls them | Full control over all ClickHouse configuration parameters |
| **Network latency** | Data traffic passes through cloud networking | Can be deployed inside the enterprise network to reduce internal latency |
| **Security isolation** | Based on cloud IAM and shared underlying cloud resources | Fully dedicated resources with custom private isolation |
| **Support for tiered storage (Storage Policies)** | Limited by ClickHouse Cloud's storage architecture | Custom SSD/HDD/S3 tiering strategies are possible |
| **Scalability and reliability** | HA and automatic failover are provided by the cloud platform | Replica and HA mechanisms must be designed and operated by your team |
| **Operations staffing requirements** | Good for small teams without a dedicated DBA | Better for large enterprises with professional SRE/DBA teams |

## 4. When to Choose ClickHouse Cloud

* **Startups / small businesses**: When you want to bring in analytics quickly and do not have an operations team
* **Business scenarios with highly variable data volume**: Such as traffic surges during campaign peaks, where cloud auto-scaling is valuable
* **Project trials and PoC stages**: When usage is still unclear and budget is limited
* **Cross-region applications**: When you need to deploy data applications quickly across clouds or countries

## 5. When to Choose Self-Hosted ClickHouse

* **Very large data volumes (PB scale and above)**: Owning infrastructure can be more economical over the long term for storage and traffic costs
* **Professional SRE / DBA support available**: When the organization already has ClickHouse expertise for tuning and operations
* **Applications extremely sensitive to performance and latency**: Such as financial trading and real-time risk control, where data must flow with low latency inside an internal network
* **Need for highly customized architecture**: For example, integration with internal data lakes or big data platforms such as Hadoop or Spark
* **Internal security and regulatory requirements**: When data must stay in a private data center and cloud services are not allowed

## Closing

ClickHouse Cloud and self-hosted deployment are not replacements for each other. The right choice depends on your **team resources, budget planning, data scale, and business requirements**.

* **If you want to focus on launching quickly, choose Cloud.**
* **If you want maximum cost and performance optimization, choose self-hosted.**

In the future, you can also consider a **hybrid cloud deployment**, using a self-hosted cluster for core data while letting ClickHouse Cloud flexibly handle non-core analytics traffic.
