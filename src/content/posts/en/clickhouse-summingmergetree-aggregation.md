When you spend a lot of time on dashboards and reports, you quickly run into the need for numeric totals and grouped aggregation statistics, like daily active users, hourly traffic metrics, and real-time counters. ClickHouse offers an extremely efficient aggregation tool for exactly this use case: **SummingMergeTree**.

## What is SummingMergeTree?

SummingMergeTree is a MergeTree-family engine in ClickHouse. During the merge stage, it automatically sums numeric columns that share the same `Primary Key`, helping you build high-performance pre-aggregated tables very quickly.

### Characteristics:

* **Automatic numeric summation**: rows with the same Primary Key are summed during merges.
* **Not real-time aggregation**: summation happens in the background merge stage.
* **No need to write aggregation logic**; a simple table definition is enough.


## Syntax and example

```sql
CREATE TABLE daily_metrics
(
    date Date,
    page String,
    views UInt32,
    clicks UInt32
) ENGINE = SummingMergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(date)
ORDER BY (date, page);
```

* All **numeric columns** participate in summation by default.
* String columns only participate in GROUP BY and are not aggregated.

```sql
INSERT INTO daily_metrics VALUES ('2025-08-01', 'Home', 100, 10);
INSERT INTO daily_metrics VALUES ('2025-08-01', 'Home', 200, 25);
INSERT INTO daily_metrics VALUES ('2025-08-01', 'Contact', 50, 5);
```

A regular query still shows all rows before the background merge runs:

```sql
SELECT * FROM daily_metrics WHERE date = '2025-08-01';
```

| date       | page    | views | clicks |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| 2025-08-01 | Home    | 100   | 10     |
| 2025-08-01 | Home    | 200   | 25     |
| 2025-08-01 | Contact | 50    | 5      |

After background Merge runs, or if you force Optimize:

```sql
OPTIMIZE TABLE daily_metrics FINAL;
```

Querying again gives:

| date       | page    | views | clicks |
| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| 2025-08-01 | Home    | 300   | 35     |
| 2025-08-01 | Contact | 50    | 5      |


## Use cases

| Scenario | Description |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-time counters** | For cumulative stats like API calls or product page views. |
| **Batch pre-aggregation** | Turn large fact tables into pre-aggregated tables to avoid expensive real-time computation. |
| **Traffic and activity aggregation** | Log analysis, web traffic statistics, and user behavior metrics such as PV and UV. |
| **Pairing with Materialized View** | Use a Materialized View to stream raw data into a SummingMergeTree table for real-time aggregation. |


## GROUP BY rules

The aggregation logic of SummingMergeTree is based on the **Primary Key columns**, and numeric columns are summed.

* `ORDER BY` columns = GROUP BY key
* Only numeric columns (`Int`, `Float`) are automatically summed
* String, date, and other columns only participate in grouping and are not aggregated

If the `Primary Key` is designed poorly, for example if it is too fine-grained or includes unnecessary columns, the aggregation effect will break down and statistics may not merge correctly.


## Advanced: real-time aggregation with Materialized View

```sql
CREATE TABLE raw_events
(
    event_time DateTime,
    page String,
    views UInt32,
    clicks UInt32
) ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (event_time, page);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_daily_metrics
TO daily_metrics
AS SELECT
    toDate(event_time) AS date,
    page,
    sum(views) AS views,
    sum(clicks) AS clicks
FROM raw_events
GROUP BY date, page;
```

With this setup, every time data is written into `raw_events`, ClickHouse calculates the aggregated result in real time and writes it into `daily_metrics` (SummingMergeTree).


## Differences between SummingMergeTree and AggregatingMergeTree

| Feature | SummingMergeTree | AggregatingMergeTree |
| ------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Supported aggregation | Only SUM for numeric columns | Supports all `AggregateFunction` types (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX) |
| Aggregation logic | Sum during background merges | Uses `AggregateFunction`-typed values and aggregation functions |
| Design complexity | Simple, suitable for counters and plain summation | More complex, suitable for metrics, quantiles, and deduplicated statistics |
| Write performance | Higher, because no special types are required | Lower, because data must be written as `AggregateFunction` values |


## Best practices and notes

1. **Primary Key design determines aggregation quality**: `ORDER BY` should be designed carefully and should only contain columns used for `GROUP BY`.
2. **Avoid column-name confusion**: non-numeric columns will not be summed, but wrong types or confusing names can still lead to bad statistics.
3. **Insert order does not affect the result**: summation happens during merge, so streaming writes do not need to be sorted.
4. **Run `OPTIMIZE FINAL` regularly**: if you need more immediate consistency, force merges periodically to ensure queries return aggregated results.
5. **Materialized View is the best partner for real-time aggregation**: it can stream raw data into `SummingMergeTree` efficiently.

## Closing thoughts

SummingMergeTree gives you a simple yet powerful way to aggregate data, and it is especially well suited to counters, traffic metrics, and pre-aggregated tables. With a sensible Primary Key design and a Materialized View, query performance can improve dramatically.
