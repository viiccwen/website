ClickHouse is an open-source distributed column-oriented DBMS developed by Yandex.

It is designed mainly for **real-time analytics** and can process **PB-scale** data within seconds.

## Architecture

![ClickHouse Architecture](https://clickhouse.com/docs/assets/ideal-img/_vldb2024_2_Figure_0.ab9606a.1024.png)

The overall design of ClickHouse is straightforward: it is built around high-performance reads, and through distributed architecture plus storage optimizations, it makes second-level queries possible even on PB-scale data.
From data ingestion and storage to indexing and query results, ClickHouse uses a storage engine architecture optimized specifically for OLAP workloads.

You can simplify the pipeline like this:

```text
Data write -> Data Parts -> Partitioning -> Primary Key sorting -> Compression -> Merge -> Index pruning -> Vectorized query execution -> Result
```

Confused? No worries. By the end of this series, it will all make sense 😎

## Features & Characteristics

| ClickHouse Feature | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Columnar Storage | Reads only the columns you need, avoiding unnecessary I/O. |
| Vectorized Execution | Converts data into SIMD-friendly batches to speed up CPU processing. |
| Compression | Compression schemes such as LZ4, ZSTD, and Delta Encoding provide high compression ratios and lower storage costs. |
| Data Skipping Indexes | Instead of scanning everything, ClickHouse can skip irrelevant data blocks directly using indexes, making queries faster. |
| MergeTree storage engine | A powerful and flexible storage layer that supports partitions, sorting keys, TTL cleanup, and is well suited to large-scale analytics. |
| Materialized Views | Precompute complex query results and update them in real time to dramatically speed up queries. |
| Distributed architecture | Supports sharding and replicas, making it easy to scale to PB-level workloads. |
| Near-real-time ingestion | Supports high-throughput ingestion such as Kafka streams, enabling second-level queryability. |


## OLAP vs. OLTP Basics

| Category | OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) | OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Main purpose | Transaction processing (CRUD operations) | Data analysis and reporting |
| Workload pattern | Frequent writes of small amounts of data | Batch queries over large amounts of data |
| Query style | Single-row or small-set lookups | Large-range aggregation queries |
| Storage model | Row-based | Column-based |
| Representative products | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle | ClickHouse, Druid, Redshift |

## Differences Between ClickHouse and Traditional OLAP Databases

| Item | ClickHouse | Traditional Data Warehouse (e.g. Oracle DW, Teradata) |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Architecture | Distributed columnar storage | Mostly row-based storage or requires extra columnar configuration |
| Query speed | Millisecond to second-level responses | Usually several seconds to minutes |
| Hardware needs | Works on commodity hardware | Often requires expensive specialized servers |
| Cost | Open-source and free / cloud usage pricing | High software and hardware cost |
| Scalability | Linear horizontal scaling through sharding and replication | Expensive to scale |


## Differences Between ClickHouse and OLTP Databases (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)

1. OLTP databases focus on ACID transaction integrity and real-time processing with frequent writes.
2. ClickHouse is better suited for **heavy read queries** with **infrequent real-time updates** such as reporting queries and BI analytics.
3. Common OLTP `UPDATE` / `DELETE` operations are non-real-time in ClickHouse and are handled through the Mutation mechanism.
