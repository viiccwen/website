When dealing with PB-scale datasets, how can you get an approximate result quickly without distorting the statistical conclusion? ClickHouse provides an efficient **sampling query technique** that can deliver results with "**95% accuracy using just 1% of the data**."

## What Is Sampling?

Sampling is a technique that scans only part of the data for statistical estimation. It is mainly used for:

* Real-time dashboard metrics
* Approximate statistical queries over PB-scale data
* Scenarios where a full table scan would take too long

ClickHouse implements a sampling mechanism that combines order and randomness through a "sampling key."

## How It Works

1. The `SAMPLE BY` column is used as the hash-distribution basis.
2. At query time, `SAMPLE K` lets ClickHouse scan only K percent of the data.
3. Sampling is **deterministic**, so the result does not change under the same query conditions.
4. When different tables share the same sampling key, sampling consistency can be preserved across JOIN/IN subqueries.

## SAMPLE Syntax and Differences

### 1. `SAMPLE k`

* `k` is a floating-point value between 0 and 1.
* The query randomly selects about `k` of the data granules for processing.
* Aggregated values must be manually multiplied by the inverse factor to restore an approximate result.

```sql
SELECT Action, count() * 10 AS cnt
FROM user_events
SAMPLE 0.1
GROUP BY Action;
```

This SQL reads only 10% of the data, then multiplies the result by 10 to restore the estimate.

### 2. `SAMPLE N`

* `N` is the approximate target number of rows to process.
* ClickHouse scans enough granules to cover at least `N` rows.
* Use the `\_sample\_factor` virtual column to automatically estimate the scaling factor.

```sql
SELECT sum(PageViews * _sample_factor)
FROM visits
SAMPLE 10000000;
```

```sql
SELECT sum(_sample_factor)
FROM visits
SAMPLE 10000000;
```

### 3. `SAMPLE k OFFSET m`

* `k`: sampling ratio
* `m`: sampling offset (between 0 and 1)
* Useful when you want to avoid different queries overlapping on the same data blocks

```sql
SELECT *
FROM visits
SAMPLE 0.1 OFFSET 0.5;
```

## Specify a Sampling Key When Creating the Table

Only **MergeTree-family table engines** support sampling, and you must specify a sampling key when creating the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_events
(
    EventDate DateTime,
    UserID UInt64,
    Action String
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate)
ORDER BY (UserID, EventDate)
SAMPLE BY intHash64(UserID);
```

Choosing a high-cardinality and evenly distributed column such as `UserID` for `SAMPLE BY` is the key.

## Example: Cutting Query Time from 20 Seconds to 2 Seconds

### Original query (full table scan)

```sql
SELECT Action, count() FROM user_events GROUP BY Action;
-- Query took: 20 seconds
```

### Sampling query (`SAMPLE 0.1`)

```sql
SELECT Action, count() * 10 FROM user_events SAMPLE 0.1 GROUP BY Action;
-- Query took: 2 seconds
```

Compared with a full table scan, the sampling query is 10 times faster, while the error rate of the statistical result stays within 5%.

## Sampling Query Validation

You can use `EXPLAIN ESTIMATE` to estimate how much data a query will scan.

```sql
EXPLAIN ESTIMATE SELECT * FROM user_events SAMPLE 0.1;
```

| parts | marks  | rows                     |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| 10/10 | 100/10 | 100,000,000 / 10,000,000 |

## Common Questions and Mistakes

| Problem                      | Suggested fix                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SAMPLE query does not work, still scans the full table | You must specify a `SAMPLE BY` key when creating the table. |
| Sampling ratio is too small, so the statistical result has large error | A range of `SAMPLE 0.05` to `0.2` is usually better. |
| Wrong `SAMPLE BY` column, so the sampling result is biased | Choose a uniformly distributed column such as `UserID` to avoid bias. |

## Conclusion

Sampling is one of ClickHouse's most powerful query acceleration techniques for big-data scenarios. With just a simple `SAMPLE BY` and sampling percentage, you can easily get approximate query results in seconds while greatly reducing system I/O and compute pressure.
