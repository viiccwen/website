In ClickHouse, table design is not just about defining columns at random. Different column properties, type choices, and compression strategies directly affect **storage usage** and **query performance**.

Today, let's dig into a few details that are easy to overlook in real projects:

* Default vs Nullable storage differences
* Type narrowing
* How much LowCardinality can save
* Codec compression tricks
* Best practices for column design

## Default Value vs Nullable

In ClickHouse, `Nullable(T)` stores an extra **null bitmap** for each row, one bit per row. Even if most values are not NULL, there is still storage overhead.

If a column is almost never NULL, using `DEFAULT` is more space-efficient.

| Setting | Storage usage | Query performance | Suitable scenario |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Nullable | +1 bit/row    | No obvious difference | Frequent missing data |
| Default  | No extra bitmap | No obvious difference | Column almost always has a value |

**Recommendation**:

```sql
-- Not recommended
age Nullable(UInt8)

-- Recommended
age UInt8 DEFAULT 0
```

## Type Narrowing

ClickHouse's columnar storage lets us save a lot of space by choosing smaller types.

**Integer ranges**:

* `UInt8` -> 0~255
* `UInt16` -> 0~65535
* `UInt32` -> common IDs
* `UInt64` -> very large integer IDs

**Floating point and Decimal**:

* Monetary values with two decimal places -> `Decimal(9, 2)`
* High-precision scientific calculation -> `Float64`

**Dates and time**:

* `Date` (2 bytes)
* `DateTime` (4 bytes)

## LowCardinality for Strings

For strings with **high repetition** such as regions or statuses, `LowCardinality(String)` uses dictionary encoding and greatly reduces duplicate storage.

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders
MODIFY COLUMN status LowCardinality(String);
```

| Column type | Space usage when repetition is high | Space usage when repetition is low |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| String | High | High |
| LowCardinality(String) | Low | Slightly higher |

## FixedString Space Optimization

This is useful for fixed-length fields such as codes or hashes. Compression is efficient, but values shorter than the fixed size are padded with zeros, which can waste space.

```sql
code FixedString(8)
```

## Codec Compression Tricks

ClickHouse lets you configure compression per column, for example:

* `ZSTD`: high compression ratio
* `DoubleDelta`: suitable for time-series numbers
* `Delta`: suitable for date columns

```sql
CREATE TABLE events
(
    id UInt32 CODEC(ZSTD(3)),
    date Date CODEC(DoubleDelta)
) ENGINE = MergeTree();
```

## Best Practices for Column Design

1. **Put high-cardinality columns first** -> improve index efficiency
2. **Split sparse columns into separate tables** -> reduce wasted space from NULL-like sparsity
3. **Use Nested / Tuple** -> reduce column count and storage overhead

## Example Design

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_events
(
    EventDate Date DEFAULT today(),
    UserID UInt32,
    Action LowCardinality(String),
    Version UInt8 DEFAULT 1
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate)
ORDER BY (EventDate, UserID);
```

* `EventDate` uses `DEFAULT`, so there is no Nullable bitmap
* `Action` uses `LowCardinality` to reduce duplicate string storage
* `Version` uses `UInt8` with a default value

## Conclusion

Table design is the first step in ClickHouse cost optimization and performance tuning.

By choosing column properties wisely, such as `DEFAULT`, type selection, `LowCardinality`, and `CODEC`, you can **save several times as much storage space** on the same hardware and significantly improve query speed.
