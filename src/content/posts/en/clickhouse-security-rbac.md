Database security and permission management, also known as RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), is an essential part of infrastructure. ClickHouse supports fine-grained permissions and RBAC mechanisms, which help ensure proper isolation and authorization of data resources while reducing operational risk and security threats.

## RBAC Architecture and Core Concepts

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **User** | Database user. You can specify passwords, network access scope, default roles, and more. |
| **Role** | A role that holds a set of privileges and can be assigned to multiple users. |
| **Privilege** | Permissions such as SELECT, INSERT, ALTER, and DROP, scoped to a database or table. |
| **Quota** | Resource limits such as the number of queries per minute or the amount of data read. |
| **Profile** | Configuration such as `max_memory_usage` and read-only mode at the user level. |

RBAC grants permissions in the order **User -> Role -> Privilege**, which makes permission management simple and reusable.

## Enabling RBAC and Managing User Permissions

1. **Enable Access Management**

Make sure `config.xml` has access control enabled:

```xml
<access_control>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
</access_control>
```

Or, when using Docker, set the environment variable:

```yaml
CLICKHOUSE_DEFAULT_ACCESS_MANAGEMENT: 1
```

2. **Create a User**

```sql
CREATE USER analyst IDENTIFIED WITH plaintext_password BY 'analyst_pass';
```

3. **Create a Role and Grant Permissions**

```sql
CREATE ROLE analytics_reader;
GRANT SELECT ON default.user_events TO analytics_reader;
```

4. **Assign the Role to the User**

```sql
GRANT analytics_reader TO analyst;
```

5. **Check the Resulting Grants**

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR analyst;
```

## Advanced: Profile and Quota Settings

1. **Create a Resource Limit (Quota)**

```sql
CREATE QUOTA daily_quota KEYED BY user_name FOR INTERVAL 1 DAY MAX queries = 1000, errors = 100;
```

2. **Create a Profile (for parameter restrictions)**

```sql
CREATE SETTINGS PROFILE analyst_profile SETTINGS
    max_memory_usage = 1000000000,
    readonly = 1;
```

3. **Assign the Quota and Profile to the User**

```sql
ALTER USER analyst
    SETTINGS PROFILE analyst_profile
    QUOTA daily_quota;
```

## Simulated Login and Permission Verification

1. **Run queries with the privileged account**

```bash
clickhouse-client --user=analyst --password=analyst_pass --query="SELECT * FROM default.user_events LIMIT 10"
```

2. **Test an unauthorized operation**

```bash
clickhouse-client --user=analyst --password=analyst_pass --query="DROP TABLE default.user_events"
-- Expected: DB::Exception: analyst: Not enough privileges.
```

## RBAC Implementation Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommendation |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Multiple users querying different tables | Use roles to combine and manage SELECT permissions across tables. |
| Strictly limiting query resource usage | Use Quota and Profile to limit memory, query count, and error count. |
| Read-only accounts or read-only API queries | Configure a readonly profile and forbid write or DDL operations. |
| Multi-tenant architecture | Use roles and database scope to control tenant isolation permissions. |

## Conclusion

ClickHouse's RBAC mechanism helps you move from static permission management to dynamic, controllable user behavior governance. It not only gives you fine-grained control over data access permissions, but also lets you combine quota and profile policies to protect resources and restrict behavior, improving system security and stability.
